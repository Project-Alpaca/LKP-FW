# External dependencies

Due to potential licensing issues, the following external libraries are intentionally omitted. Please download them and put them into their corresponding directories before opening the project in PSoC Creator.

## StripLightLib.cylib

Download FunWithLEDs.zip from [here](https://community.cypress.com/thread/16543). Extract all contents under `/FunWithLEDs/StripLightLib.cylib/` to `StripLightLib.cylib` directory.

If the PSoC Creator complains about outdated component dependency from this library, open the `StripLightLib.cyprj` file in PSoC Creator and select `Project->Update Components...`. Follow the update wizard to update all component dependencies.
